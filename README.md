# Pawtner: Pet Support Platform

In many countries, stray animals and cases of animal abuse are common and often go unaddressed. Pawtner is a web-based platform designed to allow users to report **animal abuse** and **lost/found pets** efficiently. The platform integrates **Google Maps API** to enable precise location reporting and **Firebase** for authentication and data management.

---

## **Frontend Implementation**
The frontend is built with React and uses @vis.gl/react-google-maps for map integration.

**Google Maps Integration**
```javascript
import { APIProvider, Map, Marker } from "@vis.gl/react-google-maps";

export default function ReportMap({ updateLocationOnForm }) {
    const handleMapClick = (event) => {
        if (event.detail) {
            const { lat, lng } = event.detail.latLng;
            updateLocationOnForm(lat, lng);
        }
    };

    return (
        <div className="map-container">
            <APIProvider apiKey={import.meta.env.VITE_ANIMALMAP}>
                <Map
                    defaultCenter={{ lat: 49.282729, lng: -123.120738 }}
                    defaultZoom={12}
                    onClick={handleMapClick}
                    disableDefaultUI={true}
                />
            </APIProvider>
        </div>
    );
}
```
**Interactive Report Cards with Expandable Info**

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";

export default function ReportCard({ report }) {
    const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);

    return (
        <div className={`report-card ${expanded ? "expanded" : ""}`}>
            <img src={report.imageUrl} alt="Animal" />
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> {report.type}</p>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> {report.date}</p>
            
            {expanded && (
                <>
                    <p><strong>Animal:</strong> {report.animal}</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> {report.description}</p>
                </>
            )}

            <button onClick={() => setExpanded(!expanded)}>
                {expanded ? "Show Less" : "More Info"}
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}

```


## **Backend Implementation**

The backend is built with Node.js + Express.js and connects to Firebase Firestore for data storage.

**API Endpoints**

|--------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | /reports                | 	Creates a new report, allowing image uploads. Requires authentication (token) |

## **Development Instructions**
To run the Pawtner: Pet Support Platform, follow these setup steps:

1. **Prerequisites**
   - You must have a Firebase project configured with the following services enabled:
   -  Storage (for image uploads)
   -  Authentication (for user login and report ownership tracking)
   -  Firestore Database (to store reports)
     
✅ Google Maps API must be enabled in your Google Cloud Console to use location services.

✅ Install Node.js and npm before proceeding.


2. **Project Setup**
   
For both the frontend and backend, install dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install

```

6. **Database Configuration**
   
Pawtner stores reports in Firebase Firestore. The database should be structured as follows:

```bash
/reports
    ├── {reportId}
    │   ├── type: "lost" | "found" | "abuse"
    │   ├── animal: "Dog"
    │   ├── breed: "Beagle"
    │   ├── date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
    │   ├── email: "user@example.com"
    │   ├── location: { lat: 49.2827, lng: -123.1207 }
    │   ├── imageUrl: "https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket-name/uploads/animal.jpg"
    │   ├── user_id: "firebase_user_id"

```

4. **Frontend Setup**
   
✅ Steps to Start the Frontend:

 - Ensure that Google Maps API is enabled in Google Cloud Console.
 - Run the following command to start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. **Backend Setup**

✅ Steps to Start the Backend:

 - Generate a Firebase Service Account JSON file, download it, and place it in the project root directory.
 - Run the following command to initialize the backend server:
```bash
npm run init
```

## The Google Maps API will be used for:

1.	Geolocation:
   
o	Allow users to select or view the location of a report (abuse, lost/found animal) on the map.
o	Display markers on the map for registered reports.



## Data Flow
1.	The user selects a location on the map.
2.	The frontend captures the latitude and longitude from the map click event and updates the form fields.
3.	When the user submits a report, the form data (including coordinates and image) is sent to the backend.
4.	When an image is uploaded, the backend stores it in Firebase Storage and generates a public image URL.
5.	The backend stores the report in Firestore, linking it with the image URL and the user ID (if authenticated).
6.	The frontend retrieves all reports from the backend, including their coordinates and images.
7.	The reports are displayed as markers on the Google Map, allowing users to click and view details inside an expandable InfoWindow.


## **System Architecture**

The **Pawtner** platform follows a **three-tier architecture**:
- The **Frontend** (React) handles user interactions.
- The **Backend** (Node.js + Express) manages API requests and connects to the database.
- The **Database** (Firebase Firestore) stores reports, user data, and image URLs.
